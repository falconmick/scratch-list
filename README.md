Project based off of https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot seed

A project I made for the local codeclub I volunteer at where we teach the kids how to program. 

It's main purpose is to allow us to view all of the projects that the kids have been working on without needing them to login to their accounts when they come to show their work.

After analysis of the API that Scratch provides it has become clear that the API is rather dreadful. Further development is unlikely due to lack of power from the API.
